## Other
This was written in an initial effort to learn JavaScript on my own. The code is a mess (it was worse and has been cleaned up a good bit.) It uses several bad techiques including heavy use of global variables. This will be rewritten from scratch at some point using classes and proper state management. It has been placed here in its current state to demonstrate my progress.
It is not mobile friendly...RWD was not used.
